* Derby is single instance only. So multiple instances cannot run on derby
* Using saveAsTable with overwrite probably deletes/recreates the file and so have to set spark.sql.warehouse.dir for every instance
* spark.sql.warehouse.dir cannot be modified after the session has been created
* Views are quicker to build but slower to execute
* confluent-kafka has difficulty reading a lot of data suddently (as in from redis2confluent). pykafka does fine.
